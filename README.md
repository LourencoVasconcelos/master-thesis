# IF THIS DO THAT: Interpretable Machine Learning Models for High Stake Decision-Making

Code used to implement the different models of my master thesis: "IF THIS DO THAT: Interpretable Machine Learning Models for High Stake Decision-Making"

The code for the RDLL, RDLE and RDLR models can be seen in the file "Thesis Models.py" and respective imports.
My implementation of RuleFit can be seen in the "myRuleGenerator.py" file.
